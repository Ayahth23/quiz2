I got 2 datasets from kaggle that were related to weather. I've been using the weather API throughout the labs so that seemed relevant data to use.
The data sets include weather temperature in countries around the world and city attributes such as latitude and longitude. I chose to use the map we worked on during the datathon but i loaded the new dataset i found instead of the fertilizer dataset. The map I thought was also good creativity cause you can hover on each country and the color changes. 
Then I chose a scatter plot to show the different locations. The scatter plot is more static than the map but it shows the data.
I made get, post, put, and delete requests for my database. It's honestly all over the place. I did what I knew from what we had done in the labs.
